With over two decades of experience in application security, he previously served as Principal Application Security Engineer at Amazon, including work with the Secure AI foundations and payments teams. His work focuses on the core challenge of scaling security reviews without compromising on the security bar.\n\n**Talk Description:\nThe Human Side of Threat Modeling, and How AI Can Help.\n\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll explore the human side of threat modeling: why focusing on attacker goals and business logic is essential, how to capture that in simple, actionable ways, and where automation falls short. We\u2019ll then look at how AI, particularly foundation models, can help bridge the gap, not by replacing instinct, but by scaling it, making those insights more accessible to teams and less experienced practitioners.\n\nWe will also have a second talk on Scaling Security for Non-Human Identities: A Zero Trust Approach.\n\n**Talk Description:\nAt Workday, we've built a comprehensive, proactive security program to address this challenge head-on. In this presentation, we will share how we successfully implemented a scalable security framework that integrates with our diverse ecosystem of SaaS and IaaS platforms. We'll detail our approach, which includes automating alerting to platform owners to ensure accountability and enable rapid response.\n\nThis will be an exciting evening, however please note there is a limited capacity at the venue so please ensure you register early.\n\nRefreshments will be available and plenty of opportunity to speak with others in the Security Community.\n\nA big thanks to our hosts for the evening Workday."

But while powerful, these tools carry risks: trained on vast public datasets, they inherit bad patterns without necessarily ensuring secure application development. In this talk, we'll share five key lessons for security engineers and developers to improve code security:\n\n1. Implement guardrails\n2. Get real-time security signal\n3. Watch your dependency blast radius\n4. Compensate for non-determinism\n5. Invest in prompt engineering\n\nBio:\n**Nate Michalov** is a seasoned application security professional with over 12 years of diverse experience. Throughout his career, Nate has contributed to organizations such as Endor Labs, Apiiro, Snyk, Veracode, and Annkissam, where he has focused on securing digital ecosystems while aligning technological strategies with business objectives. In various roles including customer success architect, senior sales engineer, and senior SAST specialist, Nate has consistently tackled complex challenges at the intersection of business and technology. Known for his collaborative approach and dedication to staying informed about emerging trends, Nate is recognized as a trusted advisor in promoting innovation and resilience in application security.\n\nTopic 2\n**Title: From the Engineering Trenches: What Every CISO Needs to Know About AI Development**\n\nAbstract:\nAfter leading our engineering team through the AI development transformation, from the introduction of the first copilot version to today's autonomous agents, I've learned that the most dangerous security risks are the ones created by well-intentioned security policies and practices that don't match AI development realities. This presentation walks through critical milestones where engineering and security are either aligned for success or misaligned for chaos. You'll learn how to spot the warning signs of engineering-security friction, practical approaches for building security that works at AI-enabled development speed, and why the engineering teams that partner best with security are the ones moving fastest with AI.\n\nBio:\nLeading tech innovator **David Hafley**, Head of Engineering at Pixee, blends leadership with tech expertise. Known for shaping global engineering teams, he champions large language models at Pixee, driving content and vulnerability solutions. Prior roles include Chief Product Officer at Dyknow, VP of Engineering at Contrast Security, and varied leadership roles from AWS environments to DevOps culture building.

Join us as we plug in, pry open, and peer deep into the guts of the machines around us\u2026 or, you know, just learn how the masters break them?\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\nDue to a corporate policy from the venue sponsor, to get into the venue & up to the event, you will need to register with your full name when signing up to the event **AND** show photo ID when checking in to the event on the night.\n\n**As we're still dealing with a large number of no-shows, if you don't attend without releasing your ticket, we may remove you from future events.**\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\n**Agenda:**\n**6:00 - Open doors & networking & drinks**\n**6:30 - Talk 1**\n**7:15 - Refreshments (Food & Drinks & Networking)**\n**8:00 - Talk 2**\n**9:00 - Vacate venue -> to the pub for more socialising**\n\n**LOCATION**\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nBooking.com\n6 Goods Yard Street Manchester\nM3 3BG\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\n**SPEAKERS**\n\n**Jay Harris**\nJahmel Harris is a security researcher and ethical hacker with a passion for pulling things apart - both in code and in hardware. As a director at Digital Interruption, he specialises in penetration testing, hardware hacking, and helping organisations understand the real-world impact of security flaws. He's known for making complex security concepts accessible and fun, whether he's demonstrating how everyday tech can be exploited or showing developers how to build with security in mind. Jahmel has spoken at conferences and meetups across the UK. When he's not hunting for vulnerabilities, you'll probably find him reverse-engineering gadgets, tinkering with electronics, or breaking something in the name of learning.\n\n**Before the Shell: Picking Locks and Cloning Badges**\nWe all know that a lot of penetration testing consists of sitting in front of a computer looking at code, but the question arises; how do we get to that computer? Sometimes, it's inside a building meaning we need to break several physical barriers before we attempt to get root on the server. In this talk, we'll discuss real world attacks on physical access control systems such as locks, keyfobs and badges we use to enter buildings and demonstrate how, with the right tools, we can clone employee's badges, exploit locks and brute force wireless entry systems.\n\n**Andrew Tierney**\nI asked Andrew three times for a bio, gave up and got ChatGPT to write it for him\u2026\n\nAndrew Tierney (@cybergibbons) is a hardware hacker and security consultant at Pen Test Partners, specializing in uncovering vulnerabilities in IoT devices and embedded systems. With a background in electronics and software engineering, he bridges hardware tinkering and real-world cybersecurity.\n\nA well-known voice in the security community, Andrew shares teardown threads and research on Twitter, speaks at conferences, and brings hardware hacking to life with hands-on demos. When not breaking connected devices, he\u2019s often reverse-engineering them for fun \u2014 proving curiosity (and a soldering iron) are powerful security tools.\n\n**Quick & Dirty: Getting Inside Boxes**\n\nMost infrastructure testers go straight for existing public vulnerabilities or find issues in software to exploit. But what about the hardware sitting right under your nose? Routers, firewalls, booking systems, CCTV, access control, HVAC, car chargers and lighting controllers \u2014 they\u2019re all there on site, waiting to spill the beans.\n\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll use quick and dirty techniques that find vulnerabilities in hardware fast. We\u2019re not talking full-blown lab teardowns \u2014 just fast, pragmatic hacks that turn \u201cmystery boxes\u201d into stepping-stones for deeper access.\n\nYou\u2019ll see how a quick poke can reveal hidden backdoor accounts, how dump of flash memory hands you high-value passwords, and how a downloaded firmware with hardcoded VPN keys left an entire fleet of ships wide open.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever walked past a dusty box in a server room and thought, \u201cI wonder what\u2019s inside?\u201d \u2014 this talk will show you why sometimes it pays to get your hands dirty.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\n**SPONSORS** (Thank you for supporting our community!!)\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n**Booking.com** \\- Venue Sponsor AND Food & Drink Sponsor\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-"

AI systems are embedded within social structures involving hidden \u201cghost work\u201c from Global South communities, creating digital colonialism while consuming massive environmental resources. Sociotechnical risk analysis reveals vulnerabilities extending from technical attacks (adversarial examples, data poisoning) to social manipulation through deepfakes and weaponized misinformation. These risks are amplified by model opacity, concentrated capabilities, and the dangerous misalignment between AI\u2019s actual pattern-recognition abilities and social perceptions of intelligence. Security professionals must understand that AI deployment creates new attack surfaces in critical infrastructure while being simultaneously promoted as security solutions.

That's what the Model Context Protocol (MCP) offers, acting like a USB-C for AI integrations. However, this convenience comes with significant security risks.\u200b\n\nIn this session, we'll explore how MCP's open connections can be exploited, leading to issues like unauthorized data access and malicious command execution. We'll discuss real-world examples of vulnerabilities, such as command injection flaws and tool poisoning attacks, that have been identified in MCP implementations\n\n**Agenda (Subject to Change):**\n\n* **6:00 PM**: Arrival\n* **6:30 PM - 7:30 PM**: Presentation\n* **7:30 PM - approximately 9:00 PM**: Barbecue, drinks, discussion, and networking"

As security leaders, we\u2019re asked to demonstrate that our initiatives like training, Security Champion programs, and SDL have clear benefits. But **are we considering the cognitive cost of our programs**? Every dashboard goal, every \u201cshift left\u201d security integration, and every expectation placed on engineering teams adds to their mental workload, and that load, when unmanaged, silently derails even the most well-intentioned efforts.\n\nThis talk presents practical examples for designing **security culture metrics** that are both impactful and human-aware. At the core is a behavioral science principle often overlooked in security design: **cognitive load theory**\u2014and how this tool can be used to craft realistic metrics that take the human element into account."
