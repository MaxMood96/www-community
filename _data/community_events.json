Autonomous and semi-autonomous tools are now capable of identifying, exploiting, and adapting to vulnerabilities at a scale and speed that surpass human capacity. This talk explores the implications of a world where AI-driven threats are a permanent part of the landscape.\n\nWe begin with a candid look at the current state of application security, where manual processes and outdated risk models struggle to keep pace with modern development. At the same time, AI-generated code is entering environments at an unprecedented rate, often with little to no review, expanding the attack surface in ways few organizations are prepared for.\n\nCompounding the problem is a growing wave of global regulations pushing organizations to demonstrate security readiness, often without providing practical paths to achieve it. Within this context, the traditional approach of prioritizing and fixing only critical and high-severity issues is breaking down. Attackers, especially those leveraging AI, no longer view low or medium vulnerabilities as difficult hurdles. Most vulnerabilities should now be treated as easily exploitable.\nThis session offers a sharp, forward-looking assessment of the challenges ahead and outlines key shifts that application security teams must make to stay relevant and effective in the age of AI.\n\nJerry Hoff has decades of experience in technology and security, specializing in application security at an enterprise scale. He holds a Master\u2019s in Computer Science from Washington University in St. Louis and has evaluated the security of applications for some of the largest financial, defense, and commercial organizations in the world."

As adoption accelerates, so do the risks - data theft, model manipulation, poisoned training data, operational disruptions, and supply chain vulnerabilities.\n\n**\"Scaling Threat Modeling with a Developer-Centric Approach\"** \\- Andrew Hainault & Andrea Scaduto\n\nThis talk introduces Rapid Developer-Driven Threat Modeling (RaD-TM), a lightweight, tool-agnostic approach designed for developers to embed threat modeling into the SDLC without relying on security experts. RaD-TM focuses on targeted assessments of specific functionalities rather than application-wide models, enabling iterative and efficient risk mitigation.\n\n**RAFFLE - win a prize kindly donated by our sponsors!**\n\n**SPEAKERS:**\n\n**Jeff Watkins**\n\nJeff Watkins is Chief Technology Officer at CreateFuture, where he leads AI strategy, engineering, and cloud to deliver secure, human-centred digital products for global brands. A veteran technologist with over 25 years\u2019 experience across financial services, healthcare, and retail, he is a recognised leader in cybersecurity and AI, championing \u201csecure-by-design\u201d practices for generative AI. A sought-after keynote speaker, Jeff has headlined international conferences including Webinale, AppDevCon, and the International JavaScript Conference. He co-hosts the award-winning \u201cCompromising Positions\u201d podcast and contributes regularly to publications such as Wired, Forbes, and Raconteur. His mission is clear: to build technology that elevates people.\n\n**Andrew Hainault**\n\nAndrew has over 25 years\u2019 experience working in Information Security, Information Technology and Software Engineering, for public and private sector organisations in many sectors - including financial services / fintech, energy utilities, media, entertainment and insurance. With extensive application security and software engineering experience, Andrew has delivered secure SDLC programmes and penetration testing projects. He has designed and overseen information security programmes, enterprise-level cyber risk and incident response readiness assessments, as well as delivering board-level training.\nAfter beginning his career at Capgemini, Andrew worked at Cassini Division before running his own consultancy. He joined Gotham Digital Science in 2014 and then Aon in 2016 after its acquisition of Stroz Friedberg. He has led the Security Advisory Practice in UK & EMEA within Aon since 2019(and is now at LevelBlue).\n\n**Andrea Scaduto**\n\nWith a strong foundation in cybersecurity, Andrea holds an MSc in Computer Engineering, multiple IT Security certifications, and more than a decade of industry experience. His expertise spans breaking, building, and securing web, mobile, and cloud applications, with extensive knowledge of secure coding techniques aimed at reducing the cost of fixing vulnerabilities at scale.\n\n**TICKETS:**\n\nOWASP meetups are free and open to anyone interested in application security. Please note that you MUST book your place to be admitted to the event by the building security. Your name will be checked against the guest list and a photo ID might be required.\n\n**CODE OF CONDUCT:**\n\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone.
