        "description": "**Visualizing and Managing Threats Early in Development**\nIncorporating threat modeling into the software development lifecycle is one of the most effective ways to build secure applications from the ground up. OWASP Threat Dragon is a powerful, free, and open-source tool that empowers development and security teams to identify potential threats early\u2014before they become costly vulnerabilities.\n\nIn this introductory session, we\u2019ll explore how Threat Dragon fits into a modern DevSecOps workflow and how it can be used to create clear, actionable threat models through intuitive data flow diagrams. We'll walk through a live demo of creating a threat model, show how Threat Dragon suggests mitigations, and discuss how teams can integrate it into existing Agile or DevOps processes. Whether you're new to threat modeling or looking for a streamlined, accessible tool to enhance your security posture, this talk will provide a solid foundation to get started with OWASP Threat Dragon."

With over two decades of experience in application security, he previously served as Principal Application Security Engineer at Amazon, including work with the Secure AI foundations and payments teams. His work focuses on the core challenge of scaling security reviews without compromising on the security bar.\n\n\\*\\*Talk Description:\nThe Human Side of Threat Modeling, and How AI Can Help.\n\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll explore the human side of threat modeling: why focusing on attacker goals and business logic is essential, how to capture that in simple, actionable ways, and where automation falls short. We\u2019ll then look at how AI, particularly foundation models, can help bridge the gap, not by replacing instinct, but by scaling it, making those insights more accessible to teams and less experienced practitioners.\n\nWe will also have a second talk on Scaling Security for Non-Human Identities: A Zero Trust Approach.\n\n\\*\\*Talk Description:\nAt Workday, we've built a comprehensive, proactive security program to address this challenge head-on. In this presentation, we will share how we successfully implemented a scalable security framework that integrates with our diverse ecosystem of SaaS and IaaS platforms. We'll detail our approach, which includes automating alerting to platform owners to ensure accountability and enable rapid response.\n\n**Speaker 1:**\n**Sai Charan Goud Alligeri:** \u201cSai Charan Goud Alligeri is a Senior Cyber Security Engineer at Workday with over 10 years of experience protecting digital environments. Currently focused on Non-Human Identity (NHI) security, he designs and implements scalable frameworks to address the critical risks posed by bots, API keys, and service accounts. His deep background in Application and Cloud Security gives him a unique perspective on a wide range of cyber threats.\u201d\n\n**Speaker 2:**\n**Jacob Kilgore:** \u201cJacob Kilgore is a Senior Cyber Security Engineer at Workday with many years of experience driving enterprise security improvements. Over the past year, his focus has shifted to Non-Human Identity (NHI) security, where he engineers secure, scalable solutions that enforce security controls, enable automation, and proactively mitigate risks.

AI systems are embedded within social structures involving hidden \u201cghost work\u201c from Global South communities, creating digital colonialism while consuming massive environmental resources. Sociotechnical risk analysis reveals vulnerabilities extending from technical attacks (adversarial examples, data poisoning) to social manipulation through deepfakes and weaponized misinformation. These risks are amplified by model opacity, concentrated capabilities, and the dangerous misalignment between AI\u2019s actual pattern-recognition abilities and social perceptions of intelligence. Security professionals must understand that AI deployment creates new attack surfaces in critical infrastructure while being simultaneously promoted as security solutions. The presentation advocates for security frameworks that account for both technical vulnerabilities and social dimensions of AI risk, challenging hype-driven adoption that ignores fundamental limitations and sociotechnical dependencies\n**Bio:**\nDeepankar Bhagat, Process Expert, Global Identity Access Management.

I am part time security trainer and also runs a you tube channel spreading knowledge free of cost.

How could somebody on the level of a script kiddie use AI to become way more successful and harmful to their targets. From crafting better spam emails to writing actual malware payloads, AI can do it all for you in the blink of an eye. So how could you actually do it?\n**Bio:**\nSebastiaan van der Meer is a seasoned expert in DevOps, Cloud, and Security.

Sufficient Logging and Monitoring (MCP Edition)***\nObservability is a surprisingly important part of security, yet it's often the most neglected. In an age of AI, this can get costly, especially if you don't even know something is going wrong until you get 17,000 support tickets.\nWe'll go over some relatively painless approaches to getting set up with centralized logging, metrics, tracing, and a rudimentary SIEM. We'll also go over some other potential avenues for achieving better observability, and some tips and tricks for developers.\n\n**Speaker:**\n**Robert Babaev** is a recent graduate of Carleton University with an Honours Bachelor of Computer Science, specializing in Computer and Internet Security. He has done multiple internships at major Canadian cyber companies like Barracuda Networks and Software Secured, research into authentication and access control frameworks, and competed internationally in Athens and Prague in competitions through CyberSci.

Industry experts will talk about key AppSec challenges and how these were overcome by leveraging technology, best practices, innovation and teamwork. There will be multiple presentations highlighting different challenges and lessons learned.\n\n**Featured Presentations**\n\n**Securing Today, Safeguarding Tomorrow: A Guide to App and AI Security - Andrew Gordon, Sr. Sales Engineer, Snyk**\nThis talk challenges the traditional, reactive approach to application security, where developers get stuck fixing issues weeks after they're created. We\u2019ll show how new tools and processes can empower developers to integrate security directly into their workflow, making it an efficient part of the development process.\n\nFinally, we'll look at the emerging security challenges presented by AI. We'll discuss the new \"war stories\" we anticipate seeing, and what developers need to know to secure both today's applications and the AI-powered systems of tomorrow.\n\n**Lessons Learned in Application Security from Log4j: A Wake-Up Call for the Industry - Chris Young, Product Manager, OpenText**\nTo explore key takeaways from the Log4j vulnerability (Log4Shell) and how it reshaped the approach to application security, particularly in open-source and enterprise software environments.\n\n**Agentic AI for Threat Modeling - Joseph Gregorio, VP Application Security, Frost Bank**\nThis session explores how agentic AI systems can be applied to threat modeling, enabling more autonomous, adaptive, and scalable approaches to identifying and analyzing security risks. Attendees will learn how these emerging technologies can complement traditional methods and enhance overall risk management.\n\n**Security Panel: AppSec Futures \u2013 Opportunities and Challenges**\nTopics of discussion will cover Agentic AI, defending against AI-powered attacks (deepfakes, phishing, social engineering, etc.), securing the expanded attack surface for APIs and Microservices, emerging threats from Quantum Computing, and preventing Supply Chain attacks.\n\nFeatured panelists:\n\n* Eddie Contreras - CISO - Frost Bank\n* John Dickson - CEO - ByteWhisper\n* Chris Young - Product Manager - OpenText\n* Facilitator: Joseph Gregorio\n\n**Additional Meeting Details**\n\n* Lunch Provided\n* Location: Scuzzi\u2019s Italian Restaurant - 4035 N Loop 1604 W #102, San Antonio, TX 78257\n* HAPPY HOUR & DEMO LAB networking after session!!!\n\n**Happy Hour - Sponsors**\n\n* Opentext\n* Snyk\n* Bytewhisper\n* Wallarm\n\n**Join Zoom Meeting**\nhttps://ftsc.zoom.us/j/86538235312?pwd=bU4nwzuPmmaqrA3o3qREn56bXpL8TZ.1&from=addon\n**Meeting ID**: 865 3823 5312\n**Passcode**: 429796\nWe encourage everyone to attend in person.
