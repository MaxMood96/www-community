As enterprises and consumers increasingly interact with a vast array of digital services, safeguarding accounts from compromise becomes a daunting task. Weak security measures not only expose businesses to financial loss and brand damage but also lead to unhappy customers. Identity Threat Detection and Response (ITDR) solutions offer a powerful way to reduce the risk of account fraud. In this insightful talk, we will explore typical account-related attacks illustrated with real-world examples. We will also discuss the critical non-functional requirements that make ITDR solutions truly effective.\n**Speaker:** **Bertold Kolics**\nBertold Kolics is a Software Testing Lead at Verosint (verosint.com), where he focuses on enhancing identity security through innovative solutions.

And yes, there will be **delicious food and drinks** generously provided by our sponsors!\n\n5:00 PM : Doors open, Networking, food and drinks\n5.30PM :- Chapter introductions\n5.45-6.15 PM :- Defending AI-Native Applications: A Strategic Framework for Systems That Think\n6.15-7.00 PM :- Talk: Red-Teaming Agentic Workflows: Runtime Security for the Age of Autonomous AI\n7.0-7.45 PM :- RBAC Atlas: Mapping Real-World Kubernetes Permissions and Exposing Risky Projects\n\n**Talk# 1** **Defending AI-Native Applications: A Strategic Framework for Systems That Think**\nThe rapid adoption of AI-native applications, powered by agents, assistants, and embedded LLMs, has transformed modern application behavior. These systems make decisions at runtime, invoke tools, and handle sensitive data in ways that are unpredictable and constantly evolving. For security teams, this marks a fundamental shift in accountability: defending logic that didn\u2019t exist at deployment and changes continuously in production.\nIn this talk, co-delivered by Daniel Shechter, CEO and Co-Founder of Miggo Security, and Pritam Mungse, Director of Product Security at SoFi, will explore the emerging security challenges posed by AI-native applications and introduce a new model: Execution-Aware Defense. They\u2019ll walk through how this approach reframes traditional code,and edge defenses to provide real-time visibility, prioritization, and enforcement against dynamic, AI-driven threats.\nDrawing conversations with 40+ security leaders over the past few months, the session will cover:\nThe unique risks AI introduces to application behavior and attack surface\nHow to apply a layered defense strategy to adapt at runtime\nPractical steps for operationalizing AI native defense in production environment\nAttendees will leave with a clear blueprint for evolving their security stack to meet the demands of software that thinks for itself, without slowing down innovation.\n\n**Talk#2 Talk: Red-Teaming Agentic Workflows: Runtime Security for the Age of Autonomous AI**\n\\*Description:\\* As organizations increasingly deploy autonomous AI agents and agentic workflows, traditional security approaches are failing to address the unique attack surface these systems create. Unlike static AI models, agentic workflows dynamically interact with external systems, make autonomous decisions, and adapt their behavior in real-time - creating unprecedented security challenges that require a new approach.\nWe'll explore the emerging threat landscape of agentic AI systems and demonstrate how red-teaming techniques specifically designed for autonomous workflows can identify vulnerabilities before they're exploited in production. You'll learn:\n\u2022 How agentic workflows create new attack vectors beyond traditional prompt injection and jailbreaking\n\u2022 Real-world attack scenarios including agent hijacking, tool manipulation, and autonomous privilege escalation\n\u2022 Runtime security strategies that evolve with your AI agents' behavior\n\u2022 Practical red-teaming methodologies for testing multi-agent systems and workflow orchestration\n\u2022 Building continuous security monitoring for autonomous AI deployments\nTraditional pentesting falls short when AI agents can rewrite their own objectives and interact with your infrastructure autonomously. Join us to discover how to secure the next generation of AI systems before adversaries do.\n\n**Speaker:** Aryaman is the Co-Founder and CEO of Repello AI - a leader in AI Runtime Security and AI red teaming products. Previously, he was the captain of top Indian CTF team InfoSecIITR, and undergrad from IIT Roorkee. Repello AI helps Fortune 500 companies and AI unicorns secure their GenAI applications through continuous red-teaming and adaptive security guardrails.\n\n**Talk #3: RBAC Atlas: Mapping Real-World Kubernetes Permissions and Exposing Risky Projects**\nRole-Based Access Control (RBAC) is the final layer of defense between a compromised Kubernetes workload and a full-scale cluster breach. Yet real-world RBAC configurations, especially those shipped by popular open-source operators and Helm charts, are rarely reviewed with an adversarial mindset.\nIn this talk I introduce RBAC ATLAS, a curated index of identities and RBAC policies found in popular Kubernetes projects. We will discuss key findings, calling out the riskiest projects I analyzed, the permission patterns distilled from analyzing over 100 policy objects, and concrete ways attackers and defenders can feed these insights into their daily security operations.\n**Speaker:** Lenin Alevski is a Full Stack Engineer and generalist with a lot of passion for Information Security. Lenin specializes in building and maintaining Distributed Systems, Application Security and Cloud Security in general.

But while powerful, these tools carry risks: trained on vast public datasets, they inherit bad patterns without necessarily ensuring secure application development. In this talk, we'll share five key lessons for security engineers and developers to improve code security:\n\n1. Implement guardrails\n2. Get real-time security signal\n3. Watch your dependency blast radius\n4. Compensate for non-determinism\n5. Invest in prompt engineering\n\nBio:\n**Nate Michalov** is a seasoned application security professional with over 12 years of diverse experience.

Known for his collaborative approach and dedication to staying informed about emerging trends, Nate is recognized as a trusted advisor in promoting innovation and resilience in application security.\n\nTopic 2\n**Title: Past, Present and Future of Automatic Code Remediation**\n\nAbstract: Academic projects, linters, and IDE helpers provided a foundation for simple automatic code refactoring, but lacked the depth to address complex code issues found by tools. Recently, the landscape of tools used to change code saw explosive growth. Several open source code mutation frameworks have emerged, allowing expressive and impactful code transformations. LLMs have also jumped into the picture, promising power and delivering \u201ccool\u201d \u2013 but also towing chaos. We\u2019ll explore the capabilities of these tools, including synergistic strategies \u2013 all towards answering the question: \u201care we ready to automatically fix code issues?\u201d Finally, we\u2019ll look at the horizon and make the case that the era of self-healing software is approaching quickly, even if it looks a little different than what you might expect.\n\nBio:\nLeading tech innovator **David Hafley**, Head of Engineering at Pixee, blends leadership with tech expertise.

That mental model leads to confident failure: endless scanning, training, and compliance rituals that rarely stop real threats. In this talk, we\u2019ll re-examine AppSec\u2019s go-to tools \u2014 threat modeling, scanning, pentesting, firewalling \u2014 through a new lens, so you can see why they keep falling short. The problem isn\u2019t effort. It\u2019s context. You\u2019re trying to secure a living, breathing software city using a blueprint for a castle.\n\nWe\u2019ll introduce a new model: Runtime Security. This isn\u2019t theory \u2014 it\u2019s about observing real production environments, with real users, data, connections, and threats. We\u2019re not trying to secure a castle. Your application ecosystem is a massive, dynamic city \u2014 alive, interconnected, and always under construction. It needs monitoring, coordination, fast response, and resilience \u2014 not moats and silos. We\u2019ll show how teams are using runtime visibility and feedback loops to focus on what matters, adapt quickly, and prove they\u2019re making a difference. The most serious AppSec threat isn\u2019t in your code \u2014 it\u2019s in your head. Shift your thinking, and everything else starts to fall into place.\n\n**Thanks to our SPONSOR**: *[Contrast Security](https://www.contrastsecurity.com/)*\n*You can't stop what you can't see*\n*Application Detection and Response for Modern Enterprises*\n*Stop attacks in your applications and APIs from development to production*\n\n**Thanks to our HOST**: *[Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/)*\n*Assisting our customers in creating their future*\n\n**CODE OF CONDUCT**\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone.

AI systems are embedded within social structures involving hidden \u201cghost work\u201c from Global South communities, creating digital colonialism while consuming massive environmental resources. Sociotechnical risk analysis reveals vulnerabilities extending from technical attacks (adversarial examples, data poisoning) to social manipulation through deepfakes and weaponized misinformation. These risks are amplified by model opacity, concentrated capabilities, and the dangerous misalignment between AI\u2019s actual pattern-recognition abilities and social perceptions of intelligence. Security professionals must understand that AI deployment creates new attack surfaces in critical infrastructure while being simultaneously promoted as security solutions. The presentation advocates for security frameworks that account for both technical vulnerabilities and social dimensions of AI risk, challenging hype-driven adoption that ignores fundamental limitations and sociotechnical dependencies\n**Bio:**\nDeepankar Bhagat, Process Expert, Global Identity Access Management.

There will be multiple presentations highlighting different challenges and lessons learned.\n\n**Featured Presentations**\n\n**Securing Today, Safeguarding Tomorrow: A Guide to App and AI Security - Snyk**\nThis talk challenges the traditional, reactive approach to application security, where developers get stuck fixing issues weeks after they're created. We\u2019ll show how new tools and processes can empower developers to integrate security directly into their workflow, making it an efficient part of the development process.\n\nFinally, we'll look at the emerging security challenges presented by AI. We'll discuss the new \"war stories\" we anticipate seeing, and what developers need to know to secure both today's applications and the AI-powered systems of tomorrow.\n\n**Lessons Learned in Application Security from Log4j: A Wake-Up Call for the Industry - OpenText**\nTo explore key takeaways from the Log4j vulnerability (Log4Shell) and how it reshaped the approach to application security, particularly in open-source and enterprise software environments.\n\n**Security Panel: AppSec Futures \u2013 Opportunities and Challenges**\nTopics of discussion will cover Agentic AI, defending against AI-powered attacks (deepfakes, phishing, social engineering, etc.), securing the expanded attack surface for APIs and Microservices, emerging threats from Quantum Computing, and preventing Supply Chain attacks.\n\nFeatured panelists:\n\n* Eddie Contreras - CISO - Frost Bank\n* John Dickson - CEO - ByteWhisper\n* Chris Young - OpenText\n* Andrew Gordon - Snyk\n\n**Additional Meeting Details**\n\n* Lunch Provided\n* Location: Scuzzi\u2019s Italian Restaurant - 4035 N Loop 1604 W #102, San Antonio, TX 78257\n* HAPPY HOUR & DEMO LAB networking after session!!!\n* Opentext\n* Synk\n* ByteWhisper\n* Wallarm\n* BlackDuck\n\n**Happy Hour - Sponsors**\n\n* Opentext\n* Synk\n* Bytewhisper\n* Wallarm\n\n**Join Zoom Meeting**\nhttps://ftsc.zoom.us/j/86538235312?pwd=bU4nwzuPmmaqrA3o3qREn56bXpL8TZ.1&from=addon\n**Meeting ID**: 865 3823 5312\n**Passcode**: 429796\nWe encourage everyone to attend in person.

This talk provides the context to these decisions and extracts nuggets of wisdom that I believe will be valuable to many security professionals.\n**Who am I?** My name is Dr. Lionel Saliou, Ph.D and I have nearly 2 decades of application security experience. In the past I may have written bugs to remain gainfully employed, nowadays, I am a recovering developer supporting development teams write better software.\n\n#### Talk 2- TBA\n\n**Speaker:** TBA"

But **are we considering the cognitive cost of our programs**? Every dashboard goal, every \u201cshift left\u201d security integration, and every expectation placed on engineering teams adds to their mental workload, and that load, when unmanaged, silently derails even the most well-intentioned efforts.\n\nThis talk presents practical examples for designing **security culture metrics** that are both impactful and human-aware. At the core is a behavioral science principle often overlooked in security design: **cognitive load theory**\u2014and how this tool can be used to craft realistic metrics that take the human element into account."
