OWASP Threat Dragon is a powerful, free, and open-source tool that empowers development and security teams to identify potential threats early\u2014before they become costly vulnerabilities.\n\nIn this introductory session, we\u2019ll explore how Threat Dragon fits into a modern DevSecOps workflow and how it can be used to create clear, actionable threat models through intuitive data flow diagrams. We'll walk through a live demo of creating a threat model, show how Threat Dragon suggests mitigations, and discuss how teams can integrate it into existing Agile or DevOps processes. Whether you're new to threat modeling or looking for a streamlined, accessible tool to enhance your security posture, this talk will provide a solid foundation to get started with OWASP Threat Dragon."

But while powerful, these tools carry risks: trained on vast public datasets, they inherit bad patterns without necessarily ensuring secure application development. In this talk, we'll share five key lessons for security engineers and developers to improve code security:\n\n1. Implement guardrails\n2. Get real-time security signal\n3. Watch your dependency blast radius\n4. Compensate for non-determinism\n5. Invest in prompt engineering\n\nBio:\n**Nate Michalov** is a seasoned application security professional with over 12 years of diverse experience. Throughout his career, Nate has contributed to organizations such as Endor Labs, Apiiro, Snyk, Veracode, and Annkissam, where he has focused on securing digital ecosystems while aligning technological strategies with business objectives. In various roles including customer success architect, senior sales engineer, and senior SAST specialist, Nate has consistently tackled complex challenges at the intersection of business and technology. Known for his collaborative approach and dedication to staying informed about emerging trends, Nate is recognized as a trusted advisor in promoting innovation and resilience in application security.\n\nTopic 2\n**Title: From the Engineering Trenches: What Every CISO Needs to Know About AI Development**\n\nAbstract:\nAfter leading our engineering team through the AI development transformation, from the introduction of the first copilot version to today's autonomous agents, I've learned that the most dangerous security risks are the ones created by well-intentioned security policies and practices that don't match AI development realities. This presentation walks through critical milestones where engineering and security are either aligned for success or misaligned for chaos. You'll learn how to spot the warning signs of engineering-security friction, practical approaches for building security that works at AI-enabled development speed, and why the engineering teams that partner best with security are the ones moving fastest with AI.\n\nBio:\nLeading tech innovator **David Hafley**, Head of Engineering at Pixee, blends leadership with tech expertise. Known for shaping global engineering teams, he champions large language models at Pixee, driving content and vulnerability solutions. Prior roles include Chief Product Officer at Dyknow, VP of Engineering at Contrast Security, and varied leadership roles from AWS environments to DevOps culture building.

You are here (there)\n\nOur tentative schedule:\n18:15 - Quick intro by the OWASP Lisboa chapter leadership team\n18:25 - \"HTML Smuggling to EDR Bypass\" by Milton Ara\u00fajo\n19:05 - \"Implementing a custom vulnerability management program that doesn't stop your business\" by Luis Fontes\n20:00 - Dinner & Drinks by Cloudflare\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nTalks:\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nTitle: HTML Smuggling to EDR Bypass\n\nSpeaker: Milton Ara\u00fajo\n\nAbstract:\nThe aim of this talk is to demonstrate various techniques of HTML Smuggling and how they can be utilized to bypass traditional Antivirus (AV) and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions. Despite being an older technique, HTML Smuggling remains relevant and effective against contemporary security measures, making it a compelling topic in the cybersecurity landscape.\n\nHTML Smuggling is a method employed by cybercriminals to covertly deliver malicious payloads directly to a target device through web browsers. This technique exploits the way browsers interpret HTML and JavaScript, allowing attackers to disguise their actions within seemingly benign web pages. Once a user visits a compromised page, the embedded malicious code can dynamically download files without raising red flags. This process often circumvents common security mechanisms that rely on detecting known file types or extensions.\n\nDuring the talk, I will explain the underlying principles of HTML Smuggling, present various attack vectors, and demonstrate real-world applications of this technique. Audience members will gain insights into how attackers leverage this method to bypass security frameworks, as well as important considerations for defending against such tactics.\n\nBio:\nMilton Ara\u00fajo is a Security Researcher at r19.io specializing in red teaming, malware development, evasion techniques, and reverse engineering. They help organizations improve their defenses by simulating real-world adversaries and exposing the gaps that traditional tools often miss.\n\nTheir work focuses on designing advanced offensive operations that bypass modern detection technologies like EDR, AV, XDR, and sandboxes. They build custom implants, memory-resident payloads, and stealthy execution frameworks to replicate the tactics of sophisticated threat actors. Milton also has broad experience in penetration testing, malware analysis, and offensive infrastructure development.\n\nOutside of research, they contribute to the OWASP community and teach offensive security at the postgraduate level. They also host r19.io, a podcast featuring in-depth conversations with hackers, red teamers, and security researchers from around the world.\n\n https://www.linkedin.com/in/milton-araujo/\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nTitle: Implementing a custom vulnerability management program that doesn't stop your business\n\nSpeaker: Luis Fontes\n\nAbstract:\nVulnerability management today is a tangled web of overlapping tools, scan techniques, and fragmented solutions. While Application Security Posture Management (ASPM) platforms claim to simplify this landscape, they often sacrifice flexibility, leaving teams stuck with false positives, limited customization, and poor integration.\n\nIn this talk, we share how we tackled these challenges by building our own vulnerability management program, leveraging open-source tools and deeply integrating them into our Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). You\u2019ll learn about the architecture, key design decisions, lessons learned, and the principles we believe are essential for building a successful, developer-friendly, and fully controlled security pipeline.\n\nBio:\nLuis Fontes is a security engineer with over 7 years of experience in cybersecurity and 17 years of hands-on coding. He currently works as a Product Security Engineer at Xapo bank, safeguarding thousands of clients' balance worldwide. Prior to this, he worked with blockchain technologies and conducted in-depth code reviews for Fortune 500 companies, identifying critical vulnerabilities across complex systems.\n\nHis journey in security began early, exploiting SQL injections when it was cool, and he now focuses on building pragmatic, developer-friendly security programs.\n\n https://www.linkedin.com/in/luisfontes19/"

AI systems are embedded within social structures involving hidden \u201cghost work\u201c from Global South communities, creating digital colonialism while consuming massive environmental resources. Sociotechnical risk analysis reveals vulnerabilities extending from technical attacks (adversarial examples, data poisoning) to social manipulation through deepfakes and weaponized misinformation. These risks are amplified by model opacity, concentrated capabilities, and the dangerous misalignment between AI\u2019s actual pattern-recognition abilities and social perceptions of intelligence. Security professionals must understand that AI deployment creates new attack surfaces in critical infrastructure while being simultaneously promoted as security solutions. The presentation advocates for security frameworks that account for both technical vulnerabilities and social dimensions of AI risk, challenging hype-driven adoption that ignores fundamental limitations and sociotechnical dependencies\n**Bio:**\nDeepankar Bhagat, Process Expert, Global Identity Access Management.

This talk provides the context to these decisions and extracts nuggets of wisdom that I believe will be valuable to many security professionals.\n**Who am I?** My name is Dr. Lionel Saliou, Ph.D and I have nearly 2 decades of application security experience. In the past I may have written bugs to remain gainfully employed, nowadays, I am a recovering developer supporting development teams write better software.\n\n#### Talk 2- TBA\n\n**Speaker:** TBA"

As security leaders, we\u2019re asked to demonstrate that our initiatives like training, Security Champion programs, and SDL have clear benefits. But **are we considering the cognitive cost of our programs**? Every dashboard goal, every \u201cshift left\u201d security integration, and every expectation placed on engineering teams adds to their mental workload, and that load, when unmanaged, silently derails even the most well-intentioned efforts.\n\nThis talk presents practical examples for designing **security culture metrics** that are both impactful and human-aware.
