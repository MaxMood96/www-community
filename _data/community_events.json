Autonomous and semi-autonomous tools are now capable of identifying, exploiting, and adapting to vulnerabilities at a scale and speed that surpass human capacity. This talk explores the implications of a world where AI-driven threats are a permanent part of the landscape.\n\nWe begin with a candid look at the current state of application security, where manual processes and outdated risk models struggle to keep pace with modern development. At the same time, AI-generated code is entering environments at an unprecedented rate, often with little to no review, expanding the attack surface in ways few organizations are prepared for.\n\nCompounding the problem is a growing wave of global regulations pushing organizations to demonstrate security readiness, often without providing practical paths to achieve it. Within this context, the traditional approach of prioritizing and fixing only critical and high-severity issues is breaking down. Attackers, especially those leveraging AI, no longer view low or medium vulnerabilities as difficult hurdles. Most vulnerabilities should now be treated as easily exploitable.\nThis session offers a sharp, forward-looking assessment of the challenges ahead and outlines key shifts that application security teams must make to stay relevant and effective in the age of AI.\n\nJerry Hoff has decades of experience in technology and security, specializing in application security at an enterprise scale. He holds a Master\u2019s in Computer Science from Washington University in St. Louis and has evaluated the security of applications for some of the largest financial, defense, and commercial organizations in the world."

        "description": "**TOPIC:** Evolving Your AppSec Program in the Era of AI\nJoin us for great networking, dinner and drinks, and see a presentation by **Andrew Stiefel**, Product Marketing Manager at **Endor Labs**\n\n**ABSTRACT:**\nAI is already transforming how software is built\u2014but for security teams, it\u2019s mostly just making life harder. Developers are shipping AI-generated code at breakneck speed, while security teams struggle to keep up. The challenge isn\u2019t just securing AI-generated code and systems\u2014it\u2019s evolving your AppSec program to keep pace with software development.We'll explore how security teams can evolve their programs across two key dimensions: securing AI-driven software development and using AI to enhance security workflows. You\u2019ll learn:\n\n* Strategies for managing risks from AI-generated code and autonomous agents\n* How security teams can use AI to reduce work and improve security outcomes\n* Where AI can enhance security\u2014and where human expertise remains irreplaceable.\n\nAI isn\u2019t just a security challenge; it\u2019s a chance to build a smarter, more efficient security program. Join us to learn how to make AI work for security, not against it.\n\n**Thanks to our SPONSOR**: *[Endor Labs](https://www.endorlabs.com/)*\nBuilt for Devs by Devs\nReal-time scanning & AI semantic analysis lets you find more vulnerabilities, faster.\n\n**CODE OF CONDUCT**\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone.

These threats often slip past traditional defenses such as WAFs, code scanners, and testing tools.\n\nThis API Security Workshop will feature:\n\n* An exploration of why APIs are a prime target for attackers\n* Case studies of real-world API breaches\n* A guided review of the OWASP API Security Top 10\n* Proven best practices for securing APIs\n* An interactive, hands-on lab\n\nIn this lab, we\u2019ll explore how to conduct comprehensive API testing from start to finish. Participants will gain hands-on experience in manual testing and learn how to accelerate their efforts through advanced automation tools. Together, we\u2019ll tackle the key question: How can AI help us build safer applications while making our organizations more efficient?\n\nWhat You\u2019ll Need\n\n* A device for taking notes or following along if you\u2019d like too (laptop ideally)\n* Software Used\n* Firefox\n* Burp Suite Community Edition\n* APIsec - Downloaded from [apisec.ai](http://apisec.ai/) by signing up for a free account.\n\nWhat We\u2019ll Learn\n\n1. How modern applications are leveraging APIs\n2. How vulnerabilities are created within those APIs\n3. How we can test for those vulns efficiently and comprehensively\n\n**Thanks to our SPONSOR**: *[APIsec University](https://www.apisecuniversity.com/)*\n*You can't stop what you can't see*\n*Novel attacks can appear harmless without visibility into the grey areas of your application layer.Stop attacks in your applications and APIs from development to production.*\n\n*Vendors interested in sponsoring please send an email to sponsorship.la@owasp.org*\n\n**CODE OF CONDUCT**\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone.

In this talk, I\u2019ll share my story: from writing a secure coding policy and offering it to the Canadian government, lobbying elected officials, contacting agencies like CRA about their poor security practices\u2014and being met with silence, deflection, or outright dismissal. I didn\u2019t stop there. I wrote public letters, went on podcasts, published on Risky Biz, even got interviewed by CBC. But the institutions in charge of protecting our data? Either silence or \u201cNo comment, because security.\" This isn\u2019t just a rant\u2014it\u2019s a roadmap. I\u2019ll show you the secure coding guideline I created (free to reuse), explain why governments need public-facing AppSec policies, and outline how we can push for secure-by-default practices as citizens, hackers, and builders. Because secure code isn\u2019t just for dev teams\u2014it\u2019s for democracy, privacy, and public safety. Let\u2019s make it law. Let\u2019s make it public.\n\n**Speaker:**\n**Tanya Janca,** aka SheHacksPurple, is the best-selling author of 'Alice and Bob Learn Secure Coding\u2019 and 'Alice and Bob Learn Application Security\u2019. She is currently the CEO and secure coding trainer at She Hacks Purple Consulting. Over her 28-year IT career she has won countless awards (including OWASP Lifetime Distinguished Member and Hacker of the Year), spoken all over the planet, and is a prolific blogger. Tanya has trained thousands of software developers and IT security professionals, via her online academies (We Hack Purple and Semgrep Academy), and her live training programs. Having performed counter-terrorism, led security for the 52nd Canadian general election, developed or secured countless applications, Tanya Janca is widely considered an international authority on the security of software.\n\nAdvisor: Smithy, Katilyst\nBoard Member: Forte Group\nFounder: We Hack Purple, OWASP DevSlop, #CyberMentoringMonday, WoSEC"
